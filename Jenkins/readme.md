<!-- questions -->
why deploy a VM to deploy the Jenkins server, as this will increase the cost
For running the CICD pipelines we do have free alternatives, such as GitHub actions, Azure DevOps, etc?



<!-- declerative pipeline -->
createing a declerative pipeline to clone the repo, create the image out of it push it on docker hub and deploy it using docker compose(prefered)
